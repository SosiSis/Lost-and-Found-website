Title: Student Lost and Found Platform:

Description:

The Student Lost and Found Platform is a powerful solution inspired by lost items encountered within educational settings, primarily catering to students. This platform serves as a comprehensive system that enables users to effortlessly discover and manage lost items within their school or university environment.
Users of the platform can explore a wide range of found items posted by their fellow students. Each item listing provides essential information such as a picture, title, and relevant details. By selecting an item, users gain access to a comprehensive view that includes a picture, the location where it was discovered, contact information of the owner, and additional descriptive information.
In addition to the item listings, the platform offers a dedicated findings page for each user. Within this section, students can conveniently access their own posts and utilize the platform's intuitive functionality to add details about an item they have found.
Administrators enjoy a comprehensive set of CRUD features designed to efficiently manage the lost and found system. They post items, oversee the found item list, and perform updates or deletions as necessary. These administrative capabilities ensure the smooth operation and organization of the lost and found process within the educational institution.
